A mock shopping cart project that contains at least a home page, a shop page and a checkout page. Users will be navigating these pages through a navigation bar, just like a normal working shopping website.

This project is built for learning purpose only. Thus, some minor details and functions will not be implemented.

Features that can be added in the future:
- checkout and pay
- more feedback after clicking add to cart
- more contents at home page
- better design
- etc...

If the store page display "A network error was encountered", it is probably the API is not working properly.
